# scRNA-seq
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful technique used in molecular biology and genomics to analyze the gene expression profiles of individual cells. Traditional RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) methods involve pooling cells together, which provides an average gene expression profile for all the cells in the sample. In contrast, scRNA-seq allows researchers to examine the transcriptome of individual cells, providing insights into cellular heterogeneity and uncovering rare cell types that may be masked in bulk analysis.

## How We Can Get RDS Files?
You can use the following link for RDS files. By using the link below, you will be directed to the CellxGene page, where you can download files in RDS format for the organ of your interest. CellxGene provides assistance in obtaining RDS files, which contain data related to specific organs. These files can be valuable resources for your research and analysis.
